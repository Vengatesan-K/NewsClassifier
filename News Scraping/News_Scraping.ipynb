      "Content: A secondÂ bishop was arrested by Nicaraguan authoritiesÂ on Thursday, two sources told CNN, amid a far-reaching crackdown on opposition figures and the Catholic Church by the government of President Daniel Ortega.\n",
      "Content: BishopÂ Isidoro Mora, of the Siuna church onÂ the countryâs Caribbean coast, was arrested after taking part inÂ a mass to celebrate the anniversary of the Matagalpa church, the sources said.\n",
      "Content: CNN has reached out to theÂ Nicaraguan government for further details on Moraâs legal situation and arrest.\n",
      "Content: One of the sources said they had witnessed the moments leading up to the arrest, telling CNN that Mora had briefly mentionedÂ the detained bishop and vocal government critic Rolando ÃlvarezÂ during a 10-minute homily.\n",
      "Content: The source quoted Mora as saying âwe are here praying for Matagalpa church, praying forÂ bishopÂ Rolando.â\n",
      "Content: The source added, âUnfortunately, (Mora) was arrested the next day.â\n",
      "Content: Ãlvarez, the bishopÂ of Matagalpa, isÂ serving a 26-year prison sentence on charges including conspiracy and treason. He was sentenced after refusing to leave the country along with 200 other people who had opposed the government.\n",
      "Content: One of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous in case there was a backlash from theÂ Nicaraguan government,Â told CNN Moraâs condition since the arrest was unknown.\n",
      "Content: The other source told CNN the âpersecution against the churchÂ inÂ NicaraguaÂ is very strong. We shut up because if we say something we face threats. We know the world knows, but we suffer the pain.â\n",
      "Content: Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled their homeland to avoid persecution since 2018, when Ortegaâs government cracked down on widespread anti-regime protests, killing hundreds of people, injuring thousands and arbitrarily detaining many, according to Human Rights Watch.\n",
      "Content: Protesters and their families at the time sometimes sought refuge from attacks by pro-government forces inside the countryâs churches and cathedrals.\n",
      "Content: Nicaraguaâs authoritarian government, led by Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, have since viewed the Catholic church as opposition forces and labeled the protests as an âattempted coup.â\n",
      "Content: Moraâs arrest came months after two Costa Rican nuns were expelled from Nicaragua in April, also after praying for Ãlvarez.\n",
      "Content: âThis is part of a repressive pattern against the Catholic church,â said Yader MorazÃ¡n, an expertÂ inÂ Nicaraguaâs judiciary system and a former public servantÂ inÂ the country.\n",
      "Content: âThey have jailed dozens of priests and laymen and have expelled or blocked the return of more than 200 people, between priests and nuns,â MorazÃ¡n said.\n",
      "Content: A news release MondayÂ byÂ state-owned website El19digitalÂ reported the arrest of 11 people linked to Christian organizations who have been accused of money laundering.\n",
      "Content: Ortega claimed a fifth term as president in 2021. In June of that year, his government began using a vague national security law as justification to lock up opposition presidential candidates and leaders, journalists and human rights activists ahead of the elections.\n"
